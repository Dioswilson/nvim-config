# My personal neovim config

This is my personal NeoVim config I am working on.
This config was started using [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and I am trying to make it my own. It is not even close to be finished but it is already on a usable state

### I know this readme is trash, it will probably get improved in the future
